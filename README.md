# Online Continual Learning Dense Associative Memory
The aim of this project is to develop a dense associative memory system using complex-valued hyperdimensional vectors (hypervectors) that learns continually through experience without catastrophic forgetting.

## Architecture
The memory system consists of N prototype hypervectors of D dimensions arranged in a matrix, each element a complex phasor with an absolute value of 1, making each prototype a point on the unit complex hypertorus

# For Phoebe:
Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack,
All dressed in black, black, black,
With silver buttons, buttons, buttons,
All down her back, back, back.

She asked her mother, mother, mother
For fifteen cents, cents, cents
To see the elephants, elephants, elephants
Jump over the fence, fence, fence.

They jumped so high, high, high,
They reached the sky, sky, sky,
And they didn't come back, back, back,
'Til the fourth of July, -ly, -ly.
